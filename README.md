# Additive Combinatorics Sumset Program

This program is currently being written for use in ongoing undergraduate math research into restricted h-fold sumsets.

## Current Functionality:
User options:
* n: denotes the multiplicative group of integers modulo n 
* d: denotes size d unique combinations of n integers
* h: doenotes h-fold sumset 

Functions:
* Computes Binomial Coefficients utilizing the Multiplicative formula for n choose k
* Generates a 2d array with all combinations of d distinct elements in Z<sub>n</sub> 
* Prints combinations in set notaiton 
* Computes the Mutliset Coefficient for adding all combinations

Functions under construction:
* Computes all h-fold sumsets from each combination of size d.
* Filters for any sumset containing a specific element e
* Filter for signed sumsets
